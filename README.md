# pixSortableBehaviorBundleCustomReorderingFix
this code is my custom fix for a project i had that had the pix-digital / pixSortableBehaviorBundle

# there are three files in there 
  ## init.js
    that's the bundle js file that i ovvererided so i can call my custom controller instead of the bundle's controller
  
  ## Controller.php
    containes the method that controlles every events
  ## CategoriesRepository.php 
    this one has all the DB calls every method is duplecated for every entity ex: (category; slider....)[u can make it dynamic i didn't because i had a dead line and i'm lazy]
# and at last
  if u updated my code to better version which you should do don't forget to push back it would be really good and time saving for every one who need this
